    "Now, the major part in python sentiment analysis. We should transform our text data into something that our machine learning model understands. Basically, we need to convert the text into an array of vector embeddings. Word embeddings are a beautiful way of representing the relationship between the words in the text. To do this, we first give each of the unique words a unique number and then replace that word with the number assigned."
